# Events and Deligates

## What data problem does it solve?

In C#, events lets you transfer communication between objects;  
By building a Loosely Coupled Application, you can extend  
the Application without compiler error.

It's a method for avoiding Inheritance Problems;  
follows the Open/Closed Principle.

You can add new Application functions without modifying existing Classes/Objects.

## How does it relate to Deligates?

Events are children derived from Class.Delegate
Events come out-the-box with access control over data shared.
