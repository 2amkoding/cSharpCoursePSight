# Debugging Data and Inputs

## Overview

- Common traps in debugging
- An effective approach to debugging
- Testing and stabalizing the error
- Inspecting data with the debugger
- MOdifying data in the debugger
- Fixing the dfect
- VSC data debugging features

### effective approach

#### Scientific method

- gather data through repeatable experiements
- form hyphtoesis that accounts for the relevant data
- design an experiement to prove or disprove the hyphtoesis
- execute the experiement
- Analyze, refine and repeat

#### Debugging Code

- Stabalize the error
  - Using the Scientific Method
- Locate the source of the error
  - Using the Scientific method
- Fix the code
- Test the fix
- Look for similar mistakes elsewhere in the code

##### Stabalize the error

- think and narrow the scope
- experiement and keep notes
- reproduce the problem locally
- Logs
